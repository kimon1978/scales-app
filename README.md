# 🎭 Scales App – Actor’s Prompt Generator

This is a minimalist web app designed for actors, inspired by the Demidov School's **Scale Exercises**. At the press of a button, it delivers a random solo prompt—either a **physical sensation** or a **situational event**—to support daily actor training and inner activation.

---

## 🔧 How It Works

- Press **“New Prompt”** and receive a random cue.
- Prompts are drawn from 100+ curated items:
  - 50 physical sensations (e.g., *“Caught in the rain”*, *“Toothache”*)
  - 50 events or situations (e.g., *“Doctor’s office”*, *“After a bad first date”*)
- The app is web-based and mobile-optimized. Works perfectly on iPhone via **“Add to Home Screen”**.
